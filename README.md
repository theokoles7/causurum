# CAUSURUM ("Of Causes")

A modular framework for Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with a focus on causal reasoning, systematic generalization, and interpretable agents.

Causarum provides a structured foundation for developing, evaluating, and extending RL agents with symbolic and causal components. It supports composable agents and environments, causal trace recording, counterfactual analysis, and programmatic abstractions, all within a flexible CLI-based workflow.
